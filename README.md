# Blockchain example with PHP

This is a example repository in PHP based on Youtube channel [Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/c/Savjee) in the series of videos [building a blockchain in JS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4). You can follow his github page and the code example in JS for more information [here](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin).

In this repository, I have build up and define some basic knowledge in blockchain (Block, Blockchain, Transaction, Wallet) and use package [elliptic-php](https://github.com/simplito/elliptic-php) to generate public key and private key for my wallet. 

That's all. Thank you for visiting !
